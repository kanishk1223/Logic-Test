From my learnings of this project- We have informations about transactions from two different sources (in the sheets). Our job is to match the transactions from both sources that are supposed to be the same. We want to see how many times the transactions from the first source match with those from the second source taking on multiple logics speicifed in the 'derived logic old' sheets. This way we follow fix patterns of logic in the prefrence order given in the sheet and thus come up with the matchings of the transactions in the sheets. This process helps us make sure that all transactions are correctly recorded and managed between the two sources. It ensures accuracy and helps in auditing and verification. This helps maintain the integrity of financial records.
